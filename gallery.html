Thus, in 1919, she founded the Philippine Women"s College and served as its first president in 1920. Now known today as Philippine Women"s University (PWU), it was the first university in Asia that was just for women.<br>
                                    Later on she would establish a Volunteer Social Aid Committee for war prisoners during the Japanese Occupation, establish a shelter for orphans and homeless women called Asociación de Damas Filipinas, and serve as a director of the Women"s Bureau which brought together Filipino women"s organizations and prepared them for the challenges of war.<br>
